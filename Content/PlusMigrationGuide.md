The over all layout of the main window of sandman.exe is exactly the same as the old one of sbiectrl.exe when the "Simple View" is chosen. If the "Advanced View" is chosen there are three additional tabs on the bottom of the window ("Sbie Messages" etc.), so it corresponds with what can be seen in the right picture.
